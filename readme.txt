A super basic package that prints hello world to the terminal in green.
This depends on colors version 1.4.0 to print green.

Stetch questions:

Throughout this assignment, we've used NPM Package and Node Module as 
if they are the same, while there are similarities, how do they differ 
from one another?
   Node Modules are part of the javascript library (vanilla). NPM Package are 
   additional features made by javascript programmers.

If you create a new Node Module, how do you share that code with the community?
    npm publish will allow us to create a downloadable module. In order for
    this to work, we must have a package.json file! We can use github to 
    display our respository. If someone likes what we make, they can npm 
    install it.
